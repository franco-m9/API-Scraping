# API-Scraping
Various python scripts to mess around with API requests

rick_api.py:
Uses a Rick and Morty TV show open API and lists out in a CSV each character and how many episodes they are in. Please see charlist.csv as an example output. 

basic_api_interaction.py:
Super basic script that utilizes an open API that displays different fox images. This script showcases status codes, difference between a test and json response, and also outputs random fox images / links.
